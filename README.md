This is a demo on how to code a ML model for a Kaggle Competition. 
Note- The code given is without any hyperparameter optimisation. It just a simple code which will give beginners an idea of how to code for Kaggle competitions.

The following Machine learning model uses Random Forest for predicting the strenght of the cement.
